## Requirements
---

For this assignment, I created an employee directory with React. This assignment required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
